# python_challenge for KU Boot Camp

Imported CSV data from two separate data sets to generate analysis for the PyBank and PyPoll projects.

For PyBank the data set included consecutive months and the respective profit or loss. 
Through a series of for loops and if statements that correspond to their variable or give list.
A python analysis was constructed to find answers to the following inquiries of the data:

*	The total number of months included in the dataset
*	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
*	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
*	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
*	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

For PyPoll the data set included three candidates and their votes per respective county.
Through a series of for loops and if statements that correspond to their variable or give list.
A python analysis was constructed to find answers to the following inquiries of the data:

*	The total number of votes cast
*	A complete list of candidates who received votes
*	The percentage of votes each candidate won
*	The total number of votes each candidate won
*	The winner of the election based on popular vote
